/*
Pseudocode:

Variables: q1 to q5, a1 to a5, score, and userInput

Process:
Initialize the variables, including the questions and answers.
For each question, first print the question.
Next, compare the value the user enters with the correct answer.
If the user is correct, print a notification and add one to their score.
If they're incorrect, print the correct answer.
After all of the questions are complete, print the final score.
